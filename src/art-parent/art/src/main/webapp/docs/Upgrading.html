   <h1 id="upgrading-art">Upgrading ART</h1> 
   <p>Take the following steps to upgrade an existing ART installation to a more current version.</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Download the latest ART version</li> 
    <li>Extract the zip package to a temporary location</li> 
    <li>Review the <strong>changelog.txt</strong> file to see what has changed</li> 
    <li>Unzip the <strong>art.war</strong> file to a directory e.g. one named <code>art</code>. You can use any zip/unzip utility as a .war file is a normal zip file.</li> 
    <li>Stop the application server</li> 
    <li>Backup the ART database</li> 
    <li>Backup the art directory on the application server</li> 
    <li>Delete the art directory and any art.war file in the webapps directory of the application server</li> 
    <li>If using Tomcat, delete ART's Tomcat cache by deleting the art directory in the <strong>TOMCAT_HOME\work\Catalina\localhost</strong> directory</li> 
    <li>Copy the new version art directory (from the unzipped art.war) to the webapps directory of the application server</li> 
    <li>Copy the contents of the backup <strong>art\WEB-INF\work</strong> directory to the new version's directory</li> 
    <li>Copy the contents of the backup <strong>art\WEB-INF\thymeleaf\jobs</strong> directory to the new version's directory</li> 
    <li>Copy the contents of the backup <strong>art\js-templates</strong> directory to the new version's directory</li> 
    <li>If you had modified the <strong>art\WEB-INF\art-custom-settings.json</strong> file, review the structure of the new version's file and copy appropriate details to the appropriate sections. New sections may have been added in a new version.</li> 
    <li>If you had modified the <strong>art\WEB-INF\groovy-whitelist.txt</strong> file, copy the file to the new version's directory</li> 
    <li>If you were using the demo HSQLDB database, copy the database files to the <strong>art\WEB-INF\hsqldb</strong> directory of the new version, overwriting the existing files</li> 
    <li>If you had put any <strong>JDBC drivers</strong> in the <strong>art\WEB-INF\lib</strong> directory, copy these drivers from the backup lib directory to the new version's lib directory.</li> 
    <li>Start the application server</li> 
    <li>Clear your browser's cache e.g. for Firefox, use the History | Clear Recent History menu</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>The upgrade is complete. All users, reports, scheduled jobs etc should continue to work as before.</p> 
   <h1 id="notes">Notes</h1> 
   <p>Some upgrades may require special attention or additional effort due to feature changes and incompatibilities with previous versions.</p> 
   <h2 id="30">3.0</h2> 
   <p>ART 3.0 is a major upgrade and may require extensive testing to verify that it continues to fulfill the needs of an existing installation.</p>
